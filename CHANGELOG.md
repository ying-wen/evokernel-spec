# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to semantic versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)).

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) auto-publishes a GitHub Release with the offline tarball when a `v*` tag is pushed; the auto-generated release notes are derived from `git log <prev>..<this>`. This file is the curated, human-readable counterpart.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — curated release notes companion to the auto-generated GitHub Release notes.
- `tsc --noEmit` step in CI's type-check job (catches issues `astro check` doesn't).

### Changed
- (none yet)

### Fixed

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-28 (planned)

The "production-ready, releasable" milestone. The site has been
deployable since 1.0; this release closes the gap to "ship it as a
versioned open-source product".

### Added
- **Production-grade local deployment** (`./launch.sh` + `pnpm launch`)
  - Single-command pipeline: install → validate → build → preview-detached → health-poll → 12-route smoke
  - `--no-build` / `--no-validate` / `--stop` / `--help` flags
  - macOS bash-3.2 / GNU bash-4 / busybox sh portable (POSIX while-read instead of `mapfile`)
  - `.runtime/preview.log`, `.runtime/preview.pid` for supervisorless process management
- **Health probe surface**
  - `/api/health.json` — corpus snapshot with build SHA + entity counts; HTTP 503 + `status:degraded` when any loader fails or core corpus is empty
  - `/api/healthz` — minimal `ok\n` plain-text liveness probe (k8s style, intended for fast load-balancer polling)
  - 6 unit tests for the health endpoint covering happy + 4 degraded branches
- **Offline tarball distribution** (`pnpm pack:dist`)
  - Produces `.runtime/evokernel-spec-{sha}-{ts}.tar.gz` (~2.6 MB)
  - Embeds `MANIFEST.json` at dist root with build SHA, page count, entity counts, license
  - sha256 sidecar for cryptographic verification (`sha256sum -c`)
  - `MANIFEST.json` is `ManifestSchema`-validated by zod **before** packing
- **GitHub Release on tag push** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
  - Triggered by `v*` tags (e.g. `git tag v1.1.0 && git push --tags`)
  - Dual filename publishing: stable (`evokernel-spec-v1.1.0.tar.gz`) + provenance (`{sha}-{ts}` form)
  - Auto-generated release notes from commits since previous tag
  - Tags containing `-` (e.g. `v1.1.0-rc1`) auto-marked as prereleases
- **Pricing / TCO leaderboard** (`/pricing`, `/en/pricing`)
  - Best/median/worst $/M tokens per hardware (18 cards aggregated)
  - Public formula box with all assumptions (rent rate, kWh price, PUE)
  - Honest disclaimer: 1.5–3× under-estimates real production TCO
  - Promoted to nav (between Calculator and China Hub)
- **Hardware architecture data** for all 31 cards (was inferred for 23, factual for 8)
  - New optional `architecture` block in `HardwareSchema`: SM/CU count, L2 cache, HBM stacks, process node, die area, transistor count, PCIe gen
  - `Topology.astro` renders a 🟢 **vendor floorplan** badge with full breakdown when factual; falls back to ⚠ **illustrative** for inferred
  - Hardware detail page surfaces "芯片架构 / Die architecture" sub-section in zh + en
- **Hardware comparison without card cap** — was MAX_PICK=8, now unlimited; soft warning in radar/bar views above 8; "全选 / clear" buttons; PALETTE wraps via modulo
- **Critical-routes manifest** (`apps/web/src/lib/critical-routes.ts`)
  - 12 user-facing routes declared once, consumed atomically by `launch.sh` smoke check + Playwright "Critical routes" describe block
  - `scripts/print-critical-routes.ts` makes the list shell-consumable
- **CI deployment-smoke job** (6th job): downloads `dist` artifact, runs `launch.sh`, asserts health endpoints via `jq`, runs `pack:dist`, uploads `offline-tarball` artifact (14-day retention)
- **`SECURITY.md`** with disclosure policy + tarball verification flow
- **`/api/health.json` degraded-path test** — mocks loaders to verify 503 semantics (E2E only covers happy path)

### Changed
- `data.test.ts` — exact-count assertions (`toBe(28)`) replaced with lower-bound (`toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(28)`) to eliminate corpus-growth-driven test churn (~10 false-positive events per quarter)
- README — badges (151 tests / 237 pages / 6 CI jobs), highlights (31 cards / 17 models / 22 cases), new "Quick start" section featuring `./launch.sh`
- Compare tool default view is `table` (was `radar`)

### Fixed
- macOS bash 3.2 incompatibility in `launch.sh`'s route-loading (was using `mapfile`, now POSIX `while read`)
- E2E flake: `Compare 2/8 selected` assertion (badge format changed)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-26

Initial public release. See `git log` from `158c247` (chore: configure biome) through `1502d0e` (ci+release: GitHub Release) for full history.

### Highlights
- 31 hardware accelerators (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel / AWS / Google + 9 China vendors)
- 17 frontier open-source models with operator decomposition
- 22 deployment cases with Tier 0 measured + Tier 1 calibrated Roofline
- Tier 0 + Tier 1 calculator with per-operator breakdown, concurrency sweep, TCO panel, disaggregated mode
- China hub: matrix heatmap + generation genealogy + ecosystem comparison
- Showcase: 8 auto-computed insights refreshed each build
- Bilingual (zh + en) full coverage with hreflang
- WCAG 2 AA compliance (axe across 29 routes)
- 6 JSON API endpoints
- Pagefind search with ⌘K
- 5 CI jobs (validate-data, type-check, unit-tests, build, e2e)
